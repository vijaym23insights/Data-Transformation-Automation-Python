# Business Data Analysis using Python

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on performing end-to-end business data analysis using Python. The objective was to create multiple datasets, clean and preprocess them, merge related information, and extract meaningful insights using structured analytical techniques.

The project simulates a real-world business scenario involving projects, employees, and financial data, and demonstrates how Python can be used for data preparation and exploratory analysis.

## Python Libraries Used  
- Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis  
- NumPy – Handling missing values and numerical operations  
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development and analysis environment  

## Key Python Skills Applied  
- Creating DataFrames from raw data  
- Handling missing values using NumPy and Pandas  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Merging multiple datasets using joins  
- Filtering and querying data based on business conditions  
- Extracting insights using Pandas operations  

## Business Questions Explored  
1. How many projects are completed, ongoing, or failed?  
2. Which employees are associated with which projects?  
3. What is the total and average budget of projects?  
4. Are there missing or inconsistent values in project data?  
5. Which employees belong to specific cities or age groups?  
6. How can employee and project data be combined for analysis?  

## Answers to Business Questions  

1. The project data shows a mix of finished, ongoing, and failed projects, enabling status-based performance tracking.  

2. Employee and project datasets were merged to map employees to project assignments.  

3. Budget analysis revealed the overall financial distribution and highlighted missing budget values.  

4. Missing values were identified and handled using NumPy and Pandas techniques.  

5. Filtering operations were used to extract employees based on city names and age conditions.  

6. Multiple DataFrames were successfully merged to create a unified dataset for business analysis.  

## Key Insights & Outcomes  
- Cleaned and standardized raw datasets for analysis.  
- Created a consolidated dataset from multiple sources.  
- Identified data quality issues and resolved missing values.  
- Performed structured business queries using Python.  
- Generated insights related to employee distribution and project status.  

## Business Impact  
This project demonstrates how Python can be effectively used for business data preparation, integration, and analysis, enabling organizations to maintain clean datasets and derive actionable insights for operational decision-making.
